          Based on the highly acclaimed NPR podcast How I Built This with Guy Raz, this book offers
          priceless insights and inspiration from the world's top entrepreneurs on how to start,
          launch, and build a successful venture.

          Great ideas often come from a simple spark: A soccer player on the New Zealand national
          team notices all the unused wool his country produces and figures out a way to turn them
          into shoes (Allbirds). A former Buddhist monk decides the very best way to spread his
          mindfulness teachings is by launching an app (Headspace). A sandwich cart vendor finds a
          way to reuse leftover pita bread and turns it into a multimillion-dollar business (Stacyâ€™s
          Pita Chips).

          Award-winning journalist and NPR host Guy Raz has interviewed more than 200 highly
          successful entrepreneurs to uncover amazing true stories like these. In How I Built This,
          he shares tips for every entrepreneur's journey: from the early days of formulating your
          idea, to raising money and recruiting employees, to fending off competitors, to finally
          paying yourself a real salary. This is a must-listen for anyone who has ever dreamed of
          starting their own business or wondered how trailblazing entrepreneurs made their own
          dreams a reality.
